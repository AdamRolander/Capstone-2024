- I completed 8 total 'trials'
    - Some used Standard Scaler (Z-score element wise rescaling) and resulted in gradient explosion with unsatisfactory results. Therefore, this code was not included.
    - Other trials were performed on a subset of the dataset included in this repo

- The trial in this folder was most successful, most comprehensive, and what I presented at the Prospect Ridge Academy Capstone Symposium.
    - It incorporates log rescaling and individual LSTM models for Bid/Ask data to forecast price tick direction
